## Project Overview
- This project simulates a cybersecurity threat intelligence database designed to analyze network attack traffic and security alerts.
- The system ingests structured attack log data and generates analytical insights to support Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring and incident response.
## Objectives
- Analyze attack frequency and origin
- Identify high-severity threats
- Evaluate defensive response effectiveness
- Track attack trends over time
- Detect repeat malicious actors
## Database Features
- 25+ attack and network attributes
- Bulk CSV data ingestion
- Indexed performance optimization
- Analytical threat intelligence views
- Risk scoring analysis
## Example Insights Generated
- Top malicious source IP addresses
- Most targeted network ports
- Attack type distribution
- Geographic threat hotspots
- Firewall / IDS block effectiveness
- Severity risk percentages
## Tools Used
- MySQL 8.x
- SQL
- CSV security log datasets
